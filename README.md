- mkdir from a directory wherever you want to save your project, e.g. development folder
- cd into the new folder
- git init from inside the project folder
- touch any file, e.g. readme
- git add .
- git commit -m "add readme"
- at this point, you can go to github and create a new repo without a readme
- run the commands for configuring the remote and pushing your existing commits
- at any point in between these steps, you can run ls, and git status to follow along with how your project is changing.
